# ATM-Simulator-Using-Python
🏦 ATM Simulator using Python (OOP Based)

A command-line ATM Simulator built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project mimics real-world ATM operations such as PIN creation, authentication, balance enquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and security handling.

📌 Project Overview

The ATM Simulator is designed to demonstrate how real ATM systems work internally using Python.
It focuses on secure PIN validation, transaction handling, and user-friendly interaction through the terminal.

This project is ideal for:

Python beginners

OOP concept practice

Academic mini-projects

Resume & GitHub portfolio enhancement

🚀 Features

✔ Create a secure 4-digit PIN
✔ PIN confirmation & validation
✔ Limited PIN retry attempts (Security feature)
✔ Balance Enquiry
✔ Cash Deposit with validation
✔ Cash Withdrawal with insufficient balance check
✔ Card Blocking after multiple wrong PIN attempts
✔ Object-Oriented & modular code structure

⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ User creates a 4-digit PIN
2️⃣ PIN is confirmed and stored securely
3️⃣ User must enter correct PIN to access ATM features
4️⃣ Maximum 3 attempts allowed
5️⃣ Available operations:

Check Balance

Deposit Money

Withdraw Money
6️⃣ Card is blocked after multiple incorrect PIN attempts

▶️ How to Run the Project
🔹 Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed

Jupyter Notebook (optional)

🔹 Steps
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATM-Simulator.git
cd ATM-Simulator
jupyter notebook


Open ATM Simulator.ipynb and run all cells.

🧪 Sample Output
Enter your pin: ****
Your Pin is created successfully!

Enter Your Pin:
✔ Authentication Successful

Your Balance is: Rs. 0/-
Enter the amount to deposit: 5000
Rs. 5000/- has been deposited successfully!

🔐 Security Highlights

Only 4-digit numeric PIN allowed

Limited retry attempts

Automatic card block simulation

Prevents negative deposits and withdrawals

📈 Future Enhancements

🔹 Add transaction history
🔹 Add interest calculation
🔹 GUI using Tkinter / Streamlit
🔹 Database integration
🔹 Multiple user accounts

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of Python OOP

Real-world ATM logic simulation

Input validation & error handling

Writing clean, reusable code
